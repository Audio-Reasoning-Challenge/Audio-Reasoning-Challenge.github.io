**Q1: How to determine whether an open-source model or an open-source data can be used?**  
A: The release cut-off for the model and data is **November 30, 2025**. If you want to use LLM or MLLM to label the data, you need to make sure that your audio comes from an open-source dataset and that the annotation model is also open-source released before November 30, 2025.
